Project Name: Bomb Squeegee(minesweeper clone)

1. What went well?

Our execution went well. We were able to implement our individual parts of code together
and make a functional game. 

2. What went less well?

There was some confusion on what each our tasks were as a group. The division of tasks wasn't
as even as it could have been, but because we rarely worked in person it was hard for us to 
split up the work evenly. 

3. What did we learn?

We learned that our difference in operating systems made things more difficult than they had
to be. We learned how to use an external library(fltk) and make GUI for our game. We also 
learned about inheritance and extension of classes.

4. Why should we earn discretionary points?

The final version of our game works as intended. We spent time implementing the GUI instead of 
making this a console based game. This made them most since for our game because in 
minesweeper you use the mouse to click the squares and trying to do this with a keyboard
would be annoying.
