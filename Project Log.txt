Hour 1: 
	Each of us worked on a seperate piece of the project. Since we decided to use a 
	GUI, Channing started work on that. I worked on the cell class and logic, and Brian 
	worked on the board class and logic.

Hour 2: 
	Continued working on our tasks. We had a little confusion on whether the 
	state of the cells should be determined in the board or cell class. So the logic
	in my code didn't fully work with the board class.

Hour 3: 
	Fixing my code to work with the board class and so the logic agrees. Channing 
	figured out the GUI and began working on a frame for our code to work(creating a grid
	of squares).

Hour 4: 
	Channing began working on taking our code and implementing it into the GUI.
	It took a while for this to complete.

Hour 5: 
	The grid of cells was complete and they were clickable now. The only problem was 
	making them so that they would cause other cells around them to open when enough 
	correct cells were clicked.
Hour 6: 
	Implement the algorithm for opening surrounding cells and work on fixing various 
	bugs. Finalize the game and finish up.
