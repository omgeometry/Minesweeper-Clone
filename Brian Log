Hours Log

Hour 1-2:
Spent time working on our Board.h and Board.cpp.

Hour 3:
Spent a decent amount of time attempting to get FLTK to download and run on my own computer. We ended up deciding that it was better to just let Channing run it on his machine since it was easier to install on Linux.

Hour 4-5:
Spent time working with FLTK to develop our gui and get it running. We also worked on getting the dig function to work properly.

Hour 6:
Worked on general bug fixing and cleaning up our code.
